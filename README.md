Term Project for the MET CS 669 Database Design and Implementation for Business

The database outlined below would contain all the necessary information about the Hero, Monsters, Skills, and Items that the player could interact with as they play the game.  This daatabase is a SQL Postgres database which creates tables, indexes, procedures, and constraints.

# How to create this database
Please run the scripts in the following order to create the database: 
 - create_tables.sql

 - data_insertion.sql
 - history_table_and_trigger.sql
 
The following scripts are optional to run and return results for various project 'questions' or data visualizations:
